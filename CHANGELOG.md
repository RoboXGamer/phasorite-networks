## Breaking Changes

* **Only Phasorite Buds drop Phasorite Dust, Phasorite Clusters will not drop Phasorite Dust anymore.** Use
  smelting/blasting recipe to make dust from
  crystals.
* **Phasorite Components in the inventory might lead to a minor bug.** Due to changes in the nbt tag names if you have a
  phasorite importer/exporter in the inventory and place it, their name may change to the name of the network.
